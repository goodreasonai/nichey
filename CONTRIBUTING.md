# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project!

Refer here **(TODO)** for details on how to set up your development environment.

**TODO** use [this](https://mozillascience.github.io/working-open-workshop/contributing/)

There are a variety of ways to help:

**Creating a Wrapper**

Non-technical end users probably don't want to use a Python package. Please feel free to create web apps, Mac apps, servers, or other ways to create and interact with private wikis. We ask only that you credit and link this project somehwere in your wrapper.

While building your wrapper, you may feel a need for new APIs to interact with the wiki so that you don't need to delve into internals. Please create PRs for those new features when you feel like others may benefit.

**Fixing Bugs**

If you identify a bug, please post an issue! The more detailed you are the easier it will be to fix.

If you have written code to fix an issue, please submit a pull request. If it is in response to an existing issue, please mention the issue.

**Adding Features**

It is often helpful if you pitch your idea before creating the feature so that we can determine how it fits into the overall goals of the project. But once you do write it, please make a PR.

**Critiquing**

We are open to all sorts of criticism - about the API, about quality, prompts, etc. Please post an issue when appropriate or reach out to gordon@goodreason.ai.
